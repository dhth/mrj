`mrj` needs a config file to run. Here's a sample config.

```toml
# repos to run for
# (required)
repos = [
    "dhth/act3",
    "dhth/ecscope",
    "dhth/ecsv",
    "dhth/mrj",
    "dhth/shfl",
    "dhth/squidge",
    "dhth/squish",
    "dhth/tash",
    "dhth/tbll",
    "dhth/tomo",
    "dhth/urll",
]

# mrj will only consider repos created by the users in this list
# (required)
trusted_authors = ["dependabot[bot]"]

# by default mrj doesn't filter PRs by base branches
# (optional, default: empty)
base_branch = "main"

# by default mrj doesn't filter PRs by head refs
# read more on this here
# https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-pull-requests--parameters
# the value needs to be valid regex
# (optional, default: empty)
head_pattern = "(dependabot|update)"

# by default mrj only considers PRs which can be cleanly merged
# if this setting is ON, mrj will also consider PRs where merging is blocked
# (optional, default: false)
merge_if_blocked = true

# by default mrj only considers PRs where checks have either passed or are
# skipped
# if this setting is ON, mrj will not consider PRs where one or more check has
# been skipped
# (optional, default: true)
merge_if_checks_skipped = true

# squash/merge/rebase (make sure the choice is actually enabled in your
# settings)

merge_type = "squash"
```
